# my-daily-planner

## Description:

This site will display a calendar styled such that the previous hours show greyed out, the current hour displays red and the future hours are displayed as green.  Users will be able to add an event to the calendar and save them in order to refer back to them at a future date.

## How it Works:

On page load, the title of the document as well as the current date will display at the top of the page.  Users will select a time-block that they would like to append and will then type in data and click the button at the far right.  That data is then saved locally.  The hours will change dynamically based on whether the block of time is in the past, present or future.
